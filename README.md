This project implements a machine learning model to predict heart disease presence using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health metrics and outcomes, allowing for the classification of patients based on their risk of heart disease.
Features
Utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning.
Employs a Decision Tree Classifier for binary classification of heart disease.
Data preprocessing using pandas for loading and handling the dataset.
Optional visualization of cholesterol distribution using matplotlib.
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which includes features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators.
